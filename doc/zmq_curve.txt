zmq_curve(7)
============


NAME
----
zmq_curve - clear-text authentication


SYNOPSIS
--------
The CURVE mechanism defines a mechanism for secure authentication and 
confidentiality for communications between a client and a server. CURVE 
is intended for use on public networks. The CURVE mechanism is defined 
by this document: <http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:25>.


SERVER AND CLIENT ROLES
-----------------------
To use CURVE, the server shall set the ZMQ_CURVE_SERVER option, and the 
client shall set the ZMQ_CURVE_PUBLICKEY and ZMQ_CURVE_SERVERKEY socket 
options. Which peer binds, and which connects, is not relevant.

NOTE: this isn't implemented and not fully defined. The server keypair
needs to be persistent, and it would be sensible to define a format for
this as a CurveZMQ RFC.
